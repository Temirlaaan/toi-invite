# Task: Guest Management & Dashboard

## Description
Build the organizer dashboard features: guest list management (add, import CSV, generate personalized links), RSVP tracking table, CSV export, and event analytics (view counts, RSVP stats).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Guest list page (`/[locale]/dashboard/events/[id]/guests`) with table of all guests
- [ ] Add guest manually (name, phone)
- [ ] Bulk import guests from CSV (name, phone columns)
- [ ] Generate personalized links for all guests (copy individual or bulk copy)
- [ ] RSVP tracking table: guest name, status, guest count, message, responded date
- [ ] Filter/sort guests by RSVP status (all, confirmed, declined, pending, maybe)
- [ ] Export guest list to CSV (name, phone, RSVP status, guest count, link)
- [ ] Event analytics summary on dashboard: total invited, confirmed, declined, pending, total guest count, view count
- [ ] RSVP conversion rate displayed (views → responses)
- [ ] Dashboard home shows all events with quick stats (invited count, confirmed count, status)

## Technical Details
- Guest table: server component with Prisma queries, client-side filtering via search params
- CSV import: client-side parsing with `papaparse`, server action to bulk create Guest records
- CSV export: server action generates CSV string, client triggers download
- Personalized link format: `{domain}/e/{event-slug}/g/{guest-token}`
- Bulk link generation: map over guests, format links, copy all to clipboard
- Analytics: aggregated Prisma queries (groupBy on Rsvp status, sum guestCount, count views)
- Use shadcn/ui DataTable component for guest list
- Real-time: not needed for V1 — refresh page or use `router.refresh()`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 8: Events must exist to manage guests
- [ ] Task 4: Database schema (Guest, Rsvp models)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true — can be worked on alongside Tasks 10/3
