# Task: Polish, i18n & Optimization

## Description
Complete all Kazakh and Russian translations, optimize images and performance, add SEO metadata (JSON-LD, sitemap), and perform an accessibility pass on guest-facing pages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All UI strings translated to Kazakh (kk) and Russian (ru) — both organizer dashboard and guest pages
- [ ] Language switcher works on all pages (persists locale in URL)
- [ ] Image optimization: next/image with MinIO custom loader, WebP conversion, responsive sizes
- [ ] Lazy loading for gallery images and below-fold content
- [ ] Guest page Lighthouse score: > 90 performance, > 90 accessibility (mobile)
- [ ] SEO: JSON-LD structured data for events (Event schema), dynamic sitemap for published events
- [ ] OG image generation (dynamic per event using `@vercel/og` or similar)
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on guest pages: color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels on RSVP form
- [ ] Responsive design QA: tested on common mobile viewports (375px, 390px, 414px)
- [ ] Error pages: custom 404 and 500 pages in both languages
- [ ] Loading states and skeletons for dashboard pages

## Technical Details
- i18n files: `src/i18n/messages/kk.json` and `ru.json` — flat key structure
- next/image custom loader for MinIO: `src/lib/image-loader.ts`
- JSON-LD in guest page via `<script type="application/ld+json">` in generateMetadata
- Sitemap: `app/sitemap.ts` dynamic route querying published events
- OG images: route handler at `/api/og/[slug]` generating event-specific preview images
- Accessibility: audit with axe-core, fix issues in RSVP form, navigation, and gallery

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 10–7: All feature work must be complete
- [ ] Translation content for kk/ru (can use placeholder text initially)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false — needs all features complete to polish
